todo:
--------------
more skills feature beyond just finding decos and that isn't slow as molasses
make 100% certain results are sorted so that best slots are at top 
see whats up with test_more not including the [3, 2, 1] result
    probably just a case of broadening the limits of my mod_point_map bs in get_best_armor
languages translation system, similar to what i have in pokemon sandwich simulator 
share url
dark mode
get python back on parity with js (low priority)
on deco inventory page, make red "you've got less of this deco than normal" highlight dynamic as you
    edit the input fields, not only on blur 
persist hide icons and minimize skill box options



maybes: 
-------------------------
underline/subtly color skills in selected result if they were in your search query
add weapon searching
