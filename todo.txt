todo:
--------------
use different algorithm for more skills that isn't slow as molasses (probably depth-first search)
cache more skills results until figure out faster implementation so we don't have to re-search
allow tabbing after text searching skills and then enter to quickly select one
make 100% certain results are sorted so that best slots are at top 
see whats up with test_more not including the [3, 2, 1] result
    probably just a case of broadening the limits of my mod_point_map bs in get_best_armor
dark mode
languages translation system, similar to what i have in pokemon sandwich simulator 
share url
make slot filters jump to front when text searching them in the skill picker
on deco inventory page, make red "you've got less of this deco than normal" highlight dynamic as you
    edit the input fields, not only on blur 
persist hide icons and minimize skill box options
add color option to settings for stuff like skill and slot gradients on search page
get python back on parity with js (low priority)

maybes: 
-------------------------
underline/subtly color skills in selected result if they were in your search query
add weapon searching
