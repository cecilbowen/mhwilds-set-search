TO-DO (somewhat sorted by priority):
------------------------------------------
improve 'more skills' feature.  things like, broader initial search to capture more starting skills 
make 100% certain results are sorted so that best free slots are at top, specifically:
    biggest free slots, longest free slots
improve getBestArmor() when it comes to searches with lots of skills 
    eg, try searching 19 level 1 skills; took me 30 seconds+ on non-dfs, ~10 with dfs
fix some max-level 1 skills go above level 1 in more skills results
rename your sets from search page too, so we dont have to guess which "Unnamed Set" is the one we just added
fix progress bar being slightly offset during more skills search (appears as though it finishes at eg, 115% instead of 100%)
url to auto swap to saved sets page and show a set, with an option to save it
    something like /?set=2_3_66_31_99_1
see whats up with test_more not including the [3, 2, 1] result
    probably just a case of broadening the limits of my mod_point_map bs in get_best_armor
allow tabbing after text searching skills and then enter to quickly select one
languages translation system, similar to what i have in pokemon sandwich simulator 
make slot filters jump to front when text searching them in the skill picker
on deco inventory page, make red "you've got less of this deco than normal" highlight dynamic as you
    edit the input fields, not only on blur 
get python back on parity with js (low priority)

MAYBE: 
------------------------------------------
add weapon searching
add an optional "Help" tab with tips on how to use the tool
re-order saved sets
ctrl+clicking or etc ANYTHING on selectedResult display takes you to a site like kiranico, etc for details
add color option to settings for stuff like skill and slot gradients on search page
persist hide icons and minimize skill box options
